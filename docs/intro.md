# Getting Started

**fulla** is a high-performance, open-source identity and access management (IAM) core built in C++17: a production-grade OAuth2/OIDC authorization server with full coverage of user authentication, MFA, WebAuthn, RBAC, and multi-tenancy — it can be deployed as an **out-of-the-box product** (Docker/Helm) or integrated as an **embeddable C++ SDK** (`find_package(fulla-*)`).
